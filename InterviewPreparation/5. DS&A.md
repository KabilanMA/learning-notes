## Sorting
### Insertion Sort

- Work **left** to **Right**.
- Examine each item and compare it to items on its left.
- **Insert** the item in the correct position in the array.

The array will form sorted and unsorted partitions.
(0-indexed)
```
for i: 1 to length(A)-1
	j = i
	while (j>0 and A[j-1] > A[j])
		swap A[j] and A[j-1]
		j = j-1
```
Time complexity = O(n^2). In memory sorting, therefore O(1) space complexity.

### Quicksort

It is a recursive algorithm.

```
Quicksort (A, low, high) {
	if (low < high) {
		pivot_location = Partition(A, low, high)
		Quicksort(A, low, pivot_location)
		Quicksort(A, pivot_location+1, high)
	}
}

Partition(A, low, high) {
	pivot[low]
	leftwall = low

	for i = low+1 to high
		if (A[i] < pivot) then
			swap (A[i], A[leftwall])
			leftwall = leftwall+1

	swap(pivot, A[leftwall])

	return (leftwall)
}
```

Worst case Time complexity: O(n^2)
Average case Time complexity: O(nlgn)

### Bubble Sort

After each iteration atleast one element will be in the correct order at the back of the array.

```
for i from 1 to N
	for j from 0 to N-1
		if a[j] > a[j+1]
			swap (a[j], a[j+1])
```

Time complexity: O(n^2)

## Trees

### Tree traversals
1. Inorder traversal:
	1. First, visit the left subtree.
	2. Then, visit the root node,
	3. At last, visit the right subtree.

2. Preorder traversal:
	1. First, visit the root node.
	2. Then, visit the left subtree.
	3. At last, visit right subtree.

3. Postorder traversal:
	- Left, right, then the root.
