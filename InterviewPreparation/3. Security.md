### JSON Web Token (JWT)

It is a proposed internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims.
The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.

1. What is the Workflow of JWT?

Storing JWT:
- **Cookies**: Can be stored as HTTP cookies. Cookies have the advantage of being automatically included in HTTP requests to the same domain, providing a seamless way to send the token with each request.
- **LocalStorage/SessionStorage**: Can be stored in client's browser using _localStorage_ or _sessionStorage_ APIs. However this approach has some security considerarions, as it might be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

2. What is the structure of JWT?
JWT consists of 3 parts - Header, Payload, Signature.
JWT is generated in the form of **header.payload.signature**.

### Types of Attacks
1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:
The attacker floods the server with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and making it unable to respond to legitimate requests.

2. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack:
Similar to a DoS attack , DDoS involves multiple compromised computers (botnet) attacking a server simultaneously, causing a more significant impact.

3. Brute Force Attack:
In a brute force attack, an attacker systematically tries all possible username and password combinations until they find the correct ones, gaining unauthorized access to the server.

4. SQL Injection:
SQL injection involves injecting malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to a server's database.

5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
XSS attacks inject malicious scripts into we pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or session cookies.

6. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
