Object Oriented Programming

1.  What is Object Oriented Programming?

OOP is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like inheritence, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

2. What is the difference between OOP and Structural Programming?

| Object Oriented Programming | Structural Programming |
| ---- | ---- |
| OOP is a type of programming which is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. | Provides logical structure to a program where programs are divided into functions. |
| Bottom-up approach | Top-down approach |
| Provides data hiding | Does not provide data hiding |
| Can solve problems of any complexity | Can solve moderate problems |
| Code can be reused thereby reducing redundancy | Does not support code reusability. |

3. Why use OOPs?

- OOPs allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems.
- Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy.
- Data and code are bound together by encapsulation.
- OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential.
- Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve.
- The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms.

4. What are the main features of OOPs?

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

5. What is inheritance?

Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes inherit common properties from other classes.

6. What are the different types of inheritance?

- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Hybrid inheritance

7. What is the difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance?

| Multiple inheritance | Multilevel inheritance |
| ---- | ---- |
| Multiple inheritance comes into picture when a class inherits more than one base class (Not possible in Java but C++) | Multilevel inheritance means a class inherits from another class which itself is a subclass of some other base class. |
|  | Class A {<br>...<br>}<br>Class B extends A {<br>...<br>}<br>Class C extends B {<br>...<br>} |
|  |  |

9. What is hybrid inheritance?

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and multi-level inheritance.

9. What is hierarchical inheritance?

Hierarchical inheritance refers to inheritance where one class has more than one subclasses.

10. What are the limitations of inheritance?

- Increases the time and effort required to execute a program as it requires jumping back and forth between different classes.
- The parent class and the child class get tightly coupled.
- Any modifications to the program would require changes both in the parent as well as the child class.
- Needs careful implementation else would lead to incorrect results.

11.  What is superclass?

A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other class or classes. 

12. What is subclass?

A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass.

13. What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple definitions can be given to a single interface.

14. What is static polymorphism?

Static polymorphism (static binding) is a kind of polymorphism that occurs at compile time. 
An example of compile-time polymorphism is method overloading.

15. What is dynamic polymorphism?

Runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism (dynamic binding) is a type of polymorphism which is resolved during runtime.
An example of runtime polymorphism is method overriding.

16. What is method overloading?

Method overloading is a feature of OOPs which makes it possible to give the same name to more than one methods within a class if the arguments passed differ.

17. What is method overriding?

Method overriding is a feature of OOPs by which the child class or the subclass can redefine methods present in the base class or parent class. Here, the method signature is same.

18. What is operator overloading?

Operator overloading refers to implementing operators using user-defined types based on the arguments passed along with it.

19. What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation refers to binding the data and the code that works on together into a single unit. 
Encapsulation in Java can be achieved by:
- Declaring the variables of a class as private.
- Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

```java
public class Employee {
	private String name;
	
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public String setName() {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	}
}
```

1. What is access specifiers?

It determine the accessibility of methods, classes, etc in OOPs. These access specifiers allow the implementation of encapsulation.
The most common access specifiers are _public_, _private_, _protected_.

21. What is the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers?

| Name | Accessibility from own class | Accessibility from derived class | Accessibility from world |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| public | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| private | Yes | No | No |
| protected | Yes | Yes | No |

22. What is data abstraction?

Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user.

Ways to achieve abstraction in Java:
1. Abstract Class

Abstract class in Java contains the _abstract_ keyword.
If  a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated, which means you cannot create an object of an abstract class.
An abstract class can contain abstract as well as concrete methods.

2. Interface

Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants.
In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. 
Unlike abstract class and normal classes, one class can inherit more than one interface.

23. Is it possible to to call the base class method without creating an instance?

Yes, we can possibly call the base class method without creating an instance in the following 3 cases:
- If the method is **static**
- Calling the inherited method inside a derived class.
- Calling the method using the base keyword from the sub-class.

24. What are constructors?

The constructor has the same name as the class. A constructor is also a special kind of method. It is used to initialize objects of the class.


### Design Patterns

GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:

1. Creational: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.
2. Structural: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as inheritance and Composition.
3. Behavioral: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.

#### Creational Design Pattern
The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

1. Singleton : 
 The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created.
```java
public class Singleton {
	// the single instance of the class
	private static Singleton instance;
	
	// Private constructor to prevent instantitaion from outside the class
	private Singleton() {
	
	}
	
	// Public method to get the single instance of the class
	public static Singleton getInstance() {
		// Lazy initialization: create the instance only if it doesn't exist yet
		if (instance == null) {
			instance = new Singleton();
		}
		return instance;
	
	}
	
	// Other singleton methods
	public void doSomething() {
		System.out.println("Singleton is doing something");
	}
}
```
Thread safe Singleton:



When to use:
- Logger classes
- Configuration classes
- Accessing resources in shared mode

1. Factory :
The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class.

3. Abstract Factory :
Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.

4. Builder :
Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance.

5. Prototype :
Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.

6. Multiton

The Multiton design pattern is a variation of the Singleton pattern. While the Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, the Multiton pattern extends this concept to manage multiple instances, each identified by a unique key.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Multiton {
    // A map to store instances based on unique keys
    private static HashMap<String, Multiton> instances = new HashMap<>();

    // Public method to get or create an instance based on a key
    public static Multiton getInstance(String key) {
        // Check if an instance with the given key already exists
        if (!instances.containsKey(key)) {
            // If not create a new instance and store it in the map
            instances.put(key, new Multiton());
        }

        // Return the instance associated with the key
        return instances.get(key);
    }

    // Other Multiton methods
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Multiton is doing something");
    }

}
```

7. Object pool

#### Structural Design Patterns
The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as inheritance and Composition.

1. Adapter :
Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they work together.

2. Composite :
Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.

3. Proxy :
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

4. Flyweight :
Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.

5. Facade 
Creating a wrapper interface on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.

6. Bridge
The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.

7. Decorator
The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.

#### Behavioral Design Patterns
This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.

1. Template Method
Used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.

2. Mediator
Used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.

3. Chain of Responsibility
used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.

4. Observer
Useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.

5. Strategy
Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithms for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

6. Command
Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.

7. State
State design pattern is used when an Object change it's behavior based on it's internal state.

```java
// State interface
interface State {
    void handleState();
}

// Concrete states
class ConcreteStateA implements State {
    public void handleState() {
        System.out.println("Handling State A");
    }
}

class ConcreteStateB implements State {
    public void handleState() {
        System.out.println("Handling State B");
    }
}

// Context class
class Context {
    // Reference to the current state
    private State currentState;

    // Set the initial state
    public Context() {
        currentState = new ConcreteStateA();
    }

    // Allow the context to change its state
    public void changeState(State newState) {
        currentState = newState;
    }

    // Delegate the state-specific behavior to the current state
    public void request() {
        currentState.handleState();
    }
}

public class StateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a context with an initial state (ConcreteStateA)
        Context context = new Context();

        // Request and handle the current state (ConcreteStateA)
        context.request();

        // Change the state to ConcreteStateB
        context.changeState(new ConcreteStateB());

        // Request and handle the current state (ConcreteStateB)
        context.request();
    }
}
```


8. Visitor
Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of objects.

9. Interpreter
Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.

10. Iterator
Used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.

11. Memento
The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.

### Concurrency
> Concurrency is when two tasks can start, run, and complete in **overlapping time periods**. It doesn't  necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant.

**Processes** and **Threads** are the two basic units of execution in concurrent programming.

##### Process
A unit of program execution. 
Process is often seen as synonymous with programs or applications, however, single application can be a set of cooperating processes.

A process has a self-contained execution environment, its own memory space.

##### Thread
Threads can be considered as lightweight processes. 
Threads exist within a process - every process has at least one.
Threads share the process's resources,including memory.

In Java, a thread can be created by two ways;
1. Using Runnable interface

```java
public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable {
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from a thread!);
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		(new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start();
	}
}
```

2. Using the Thread Class

```java
public class HelloThread extends Thread {
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from a thread!);
	}
}

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Thread myThread = new HelloThread();
		myThread.start();
	}
}
```

### SOLID Principles
1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle.
2. **O**pen-closed principle.
3. **L**iskov substitution principle.
4. **I**nterface segregation principle.
5. **D**ependency inversion principle.
