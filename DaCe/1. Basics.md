__DaCe__ : Data-Centric Parallel Programming

- DaCe is a _fast_ parallel programming framework that takes code in Python/Numpy or other programming languages, and maps it to high-performance __CPU__, __GPU__, and __FPGA__ programs, which can be optimized to achieve state-of-the-art.

- Internally, __DaCe__ uses the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG) data-centric intermediate representation: A transformable, interactive representation of code based on data movement.
