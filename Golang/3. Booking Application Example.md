Application should:
1. Should greet the users when visiting the application

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	conferenceName := "Go Conference" // create a variable of string type and assign the value
	// const conferenceTickets = 50
	const conferenceTickets uint16 = 50
	var remainingTickets uint16 = 50
	
	fmt.Printf("conferenceTickets is %T, remainingTickets is %T, conferenceName is %T\n", conferenceTickets, remainingTickets, conferenceName)
	
	fmt.Printf("Welcome to %v booking application\n", conferenceName)
	fmt.Printf("We have total of %v tickets and %v are still available\n", conferenceTickets, remainingTickets)
	fmt.Printf("Get your tickets here to attend\n")

}
```

2. Should accept user input

```go
var firstName string
var lastName string
var email string
var userTickets int

// ask user information
fmt.Print("Enter your first name: ")
fmt.Scan(&firstName)

fmt.Print("Enter your last name: ")
fmt.Scan(&lastName)

fmt.Print("Enter your email address: ")
fmt.Scan(&email)

fmt.Print("Enter number of tickets: ")
fmt.Scan(&userTickets)

fmt.Printf("Thank you %v %v for booking %v tickets, You will receive a confirmation email at %v\n", firstName, lastName, userTickets, email)
```

3. Logic to book ticket

```go
remainingTickets = remainingTickets - userTickets;
```
