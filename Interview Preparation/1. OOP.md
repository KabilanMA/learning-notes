Object Oriented Programming

1.  What is Object Oriented Programming?

OOP is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like inheritence, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

2. What is the difference between OOP and Structural Programming?

| Object Oriented Programming | Structural Programming |
| ---- | ---- |
| OOP is a type of programming which is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. | Provides logical structure to a program where programs are divided into functions. |
| Bottom-up approach | Top-down approach |
| Provides data hiding | Does not provide data hiding |
| Can solve problems of any complexity | Can solve moderate problems |
| Code can be reused thereby reducing redundancy | Does not support code reusability. |

3. Why use OOPs?

- OOPs allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems.
- Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy.
- Data and code are bound together by encapsulation.
- OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential.
- Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve.
- The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms.

4. What are the main features of OOPs?

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

5. What is inheritance?

Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes inherit common properties from other classes.

6. What are the different types of inheritance?

- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Multilevel inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Hybrid inheritance

7. What is the difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance?

| Multiple inheritance | Multilevel inheritance |
| ---- | ---- |
| Multiple inheritance comes into picture when a class inherits more than one base class (Not possible in Java but C++) | Multilevel inheritance means a class inherits from another class which itself is a subclass of some other base class. |
|  | Class A {<br>...<br>}<br>Class B extends A {<br>...<br>}<br>Class C extends B {<br>...<br>} |
|  |  |

9. What is hybrid inheritance?

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and multi-level inheritance.

9. What is hierarchical inheritance?

Hierarchical inheritance refers to inheritance where one class has more than one subclasses.

10. What are the limitations of inheritance?

- Increases the time and effort required to execute a program as it requires jumping back and forth between different classes.
- The parent class and the child class get tightly coupled.
- Any modifications to the program would require changes both in the parent as well as the child class.
- Needs careful implementation else would lead to incorrect results.

11.  What is superclass?

A superclass or base class is a class that acts as a parent to some other class or classes. 

12. What is subclass?

A class that inherits from another class is called the subclass.

13. What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism refers to the ability to exist in multiple forms. Multiple definitions can be given to a single interface.

14. What is static polymorphism?

Static polymorphism (static binding) is a kind of polymorphism that occurs at compile time. 
An example of compile-time polymorphism is method overloading.

15. What is dynamic polymorphism?

Runtime polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism (dynamic binding) is a type of polymorphism which is resolved during runtime.
An example of runtime polymorphism is method overriding.

16. What is method overloading?

Method overloading is a feature of OOPs which makes it possible to give the same name to more than one methods within a class if the arguments passed differ.

17. What is method overriding?

Method overriding is a feature of OOPs by which the child class or the subclass can redefine methods present in the base class or parent class. Here, the method signature is same.

18. What is operator overloading?

Operator overloading refers to implementing operators using user-defined types based on the arguments passed along with it.

19. What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation refers to binding the data and the code that works on together into a single unit. 
Encapsulation in Java can be achieved by:
- Declaring the variables of a class as private.
- Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

```java
public class Employee {
	private String name;
	
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public String setName() {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	}
}
```

1. What is access specifiers?

It determine the accessibility of methods, classes, etc in OOPs. These access specifiers allow the implementation of encapsulation.
The most common access specifiers are _public_, _private_, _protected_.

21. What is the difference between public, private, and protected access modifiers?

| Name | Accessibility from own class | Accessibility from derived class | Accessibility from world |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| public | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| private | Yes | No | No |
| protected | Yes | Yes | No |

22. What is data abstraction?

Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user.

Ways to achieve abstraction in Java:
1. Abstract Class

Abstract class in Java contains the _abstract_ keyword.
If  a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated, which means you cannot create an object of an abstract class.
An abstract class can contain abstract as well as concrete methods.

2. Interface

Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants.
In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. 
Unlike abstract class and normal classes, one class can inherit more than one interface.
