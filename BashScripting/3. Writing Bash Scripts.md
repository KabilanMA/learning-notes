## First Program

Open the terminal and create a bash file called shelltest.sh.
```bash
vim shelltest.sh
```
Write the following in the script file and save it.
```bash
echo Hello World!
```
Execute the script with the following command.
```bash
bash shelltest.sh
```
Before executing, we have to confirm which scripting use (bash) in the script file.
We can get the path to our bash shell and copy the path.
```bash
echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
```
Paste the path in the script file's top.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello World!
```
It is a way of telling the shell script which shell interpreter. It creates the better portability.

Now we can directly execute the shell script without *bash* command.
```bash
./shelltest.sh
bash: ./shelltest.sh: Permission denied
```
This is will not execute because we need to give the file for execution permission to execute.

Execute the following command to see if your file has executable permission:
```bash
ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kabilan kabilan 30 Dec 20 12:19 shelltest.sh
```
We can see it has only read and write permission.

Give the file executable permission.

```bash
chmod u+x shelltest.sh
```
Now execute the shelltest.sh to see the output.

## Using Variables

Just like any other programming languages, we can always create variables to store the repeating values.

Inline variables handling.
```bash
FIRST_NAME=Kabilan
echo Hello $FIRST_NAME
Hello Kabilan
```

Using variables in the script.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

FIRST_NAME=Kabilan
LAST_NAME=Mahathevan
echo Hello $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME
```
Execute the script:
```bash
./shelltest.sh
Hello Kabilan Mahathevan
```
