## Operator & Operands
An **operator** is a symbol or keyword that performs operations on one or more operands.
An **operand** is a value or a variable on which the operation is performed.
Operators are fundamental building blocks of expressions and statements in a programming language.
#### Difference between operator and function
An operator is compiled to a sequence of instructions by the compiler. But if the code calls a function, it has to jump to a separate piece of code.
