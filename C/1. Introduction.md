C source files can be created by any text editor, and their filenames usually end with *.c*.

1. C programs normally begin with a comment.
	The comment describes the purpose of the code in the file, and might include some license or copyright information.
	This is not an absolute need but a good practice.

2. Include Section
	Helps to call external libraries.
	This tells the compiler what external code to use by including header files for the relevant libraries.

3. Functions
	All C code runs inside functions.
	The most important function is called the *main()* function because it is the starting point for all of the code in your program.

### The main() function breakdown

The success of the main function should return integer value 0

### Running the Program
C is a compiled language. Therefore need to compile the source code into machine code. 

To compile the code, we need **compiler**. One of the most popular *C* compilers is the *GNU Compiler Collection* or **gcc**. 

1. Save the code in a *.c* file.
2. Compile the code by *gcc*.
	```bash
	gcc main.c -o main
```
3. Run the compiled program.
	```bash
	./main
```
Have to prefix the program with *./* when running in Unix based system because Unix-style OSs need to be informed the directory in which the program resides to run the program.

Can compile and run with one line:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main && ./main
```
*&&* tells to run the command on the right side if the execution of the command on the left side is successful.

### String
The C language doesnâ€™t support strings out of the box. Instead it uses *an [[C/1. Introduction#Array| array]] of single characters*. 

When 20 letter string is needed, we need define the variable as follow. 
```C
char name[21];
```
Defining the variable like this allows us to have only 20 character string. Last character has to be the **sentinel character**, \0 , which shows when to stop when reading the string.

### Array

Arrays are used to store same type of data together. Array size has to be defined when defining the array. 

```c
int val[2];
```
`val` has 2 space to include two different integer values.

> The array variable can be used as a **[[2. Memory and Pointers#Array variables|pointer]]** to the start of the array in memory.

### If statement
`if` statement is used to control the flow of the application. Do something only when the conditional statement is true.

```c
if (condition_1) {
	// do something when condition_1 is true
} else if (condition_2) {
	// do something when condition_1 is false and condition_2 is true
} else {
	// do something when both condition_1 and condition_2 are false
}
```

### Switch statement
Instead of using `if` statements for checking the conditional variable where checking again and again is required, use `switch` statement instead.

```c
switch (train) {
case 37:
	winnings = winnings + 50;
	break;
case 65:
	puts("Jackpot!");
	winnings = winnings + 80;
	break;
case 12:
	winnings = winnings+20;
	break;
default:
	winnings = 0;
}
```
Switch statement will run until it reaches a `break` statement.

### While loop
Loops are a special type of control statement. A control statement decides if a section of code will be run, but a loop statement decides how many times a piece code will be run.

The most basic kind of loop in C is the while loop.

```c
while (condition) {
	// code to run until the condition becomes false.
}
```
Inside the loop, we can use `break` statement to break out of the loop and use `continue` statement to re-execute by skipping the remaining code lines.

### do-while loop
In-contrast to While loop, do while loop, first execute the code then check for the condition to continue the loop.
This execute the code atleast for once.
