C source files can be created by any text editor, and their filenames usually end with *.c*.

1. C programs normally begin with a comment.
	The comment describes the purpose of the code in the file, and might include some license or copyright information.
	This is not an absolute need but a good practice.

2. Include Section
	Helps to call external libraries.
	This tells the compiler what external code to use by including header files for the relevant libraries.

3. Functions
	All C code runs inside functions.
	The most important function is called the *main()* function because it is the starting point for all of the code in your program.

### The main() function breakdown

The success of the main function should return integer value 0

### Running the Program
C is a compiled language. Therefore need to compile the source code into machine code. 

To compile the code, we need **compiler**. One of the most popular *C* compilers is the *GNU Compiler Collection* or **gcc**. 

1. Save the code in a *.c* file.
2. Compile the code by *gcc*.
	```bash
	gcc main.c -o main
```
3. Run the compiled program.
	```bash
	./main
```
Have to prefix the program with *./* when running in Unix based system because Unix-style OSs need to be informed the directory in which the program resides to run the program.

Can compile and run with one line:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main && ./main
```
*&&* tells to run the command on the right side if the execution of the command on the left side is successful.

### String
The C language doesnâ€™t support strings out of the box. Instead it uses *an array of single characters*. 

When 20 letter string is needed, we need define the variable as follow. 
```C
char name[21];
```
Defining the variable like this allows us to have only 20 character string. Last character has to be the **sentinel character**, \0 , which shows when to stop when reading the string.
