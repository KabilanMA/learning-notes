## Bitmap Indexing
- Data indexing technique used in DBMS to improve the performance of read-only queries that involve large datasets. 
- **Bitmap Index** is a data structure that represents the presence or absence of data values in a **table** or **column**.

- Each **distinct** value in a column is assigned a bit vector that represents the presence or absence of that value in each row of the table.

A bitmap is a combination of two words: **bit** and **map**.
- **Bit**: A smallest unit of data in a computer.
- **Map**: A way of organizing things.
